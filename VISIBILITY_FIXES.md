# Skills and Projects Visibility Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Skills Section Issues:
1. **Missing closing brace** in `.skill-bar` SCSS selector
2. **Progress bars set to 0% width** by default, making them invisible
3. **CSS custom properties not properly applied** from React component

### Skills Section Fixes:
1. ✅ **Fixed SCSS syntax error** - Added missing closing brace
2. ✅ **Added intersection observer** - Animates progress bars when section comes into view
3. ✅ **Implemented staggered animations** - Each skill bar animates with 100ms delay
4. ✅ **Added fallback mechanism** - Shows skills after 2 seconds if intersection observer fails
5. ✅ **Updated skill data** - Changed "Tailwind CSS" to "SCSS" to reflect the conversion

### Projects Section Enhancements:
1. ✅ **Added fade-in animations** - Project cards animate into view
2. ✅ **Added intersection observer** - Triggers animations when projects section is visible
3. ✅ **Implemented staggered card animations** - Each project card appears with 100ms delay

## Technical Implementation

### Skills Progress Bars:
```scss
.skill-progress {
  width: 0%; // Start invisible
  transition: width 1.5s ease-out;
  
  &[data-level] {
    width: 5%; // Show minimal initially
  }
  
  &.animated {
    width: var(--skill-width, 0%); // Animate to full width
  }
}
```

### Projects Fade-in Animation:
```scss
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(30px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

.projects__card.fade-in {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.6s ease-out forwards;
}
```

### JavaScript Intersection Observer:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    (entries) => {
      entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
          // Trigger animations with staggered delays
          const elements = entry.target.querySelectorAll('.animatable');
          elements.forEach((element, index) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
              element.classList.add('animated');
            }, index * 100);
          });
        }
      });
    },
    { threshold: 0.2 }
  );
}, []);
```

## Result:
- ✅ Skills progress bars now animate smoothly when the section comes into view
- ✅ Project cards fade in with staggered timing for better visual appeal
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms ensure content is always visible
- ✅ Improved user experience with smooth, professional animations

## Testing:
1. Scroll to the Skills section - progress bars should animate to their respective levels
2. Scroll to the Projects section - cards should fade in from bottom with stagger effect
3. If JavaScript is disabled, content remains visible with fallback styling
